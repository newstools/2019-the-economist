THE FIRST time Wang Zhi performed in drag, 17 years ago, it was in a seedy gay bar three hours’ drive from his university dorm. Today Mr Wang (pictured) says he can make a tidy 2m yuan ($290,000) a year from his cross-dressing routines. Remarkably, they have the Communist Party’s blessing. He regularly appears on nationally televised variety shows. Officials often invite him to entertain people in poor areas. In Xinjiang and Tibet, he boasts, he has enraptured his ethnic-minority audiences. Mr Wang’s success may seem surprising. In recent years the party has been trying to sanitise or suppress any kind of culture that it does not regard as wholesome—including art that challenges conventional gender roles. Last September Xinhua, a state-run news agency, condemned some male performers simply for looking too feminine. Unusually, the party’s main mouthpiece, People’s Daily, retorted that men should be judged by their character, not appearance. But Xinhua’s views reflected a conservative turn since Xi Jinping became China’s leader in 2012.  Mr Xi, however, has allowed Mr Wang’s style of drag to flourish. That is because it has a long and respected history in traditional Chinese opera, an art form which Mr Xi has been trying to promote. It used to be that female operatic roles, or dan, were always played by men. Such acting requires considerable skill as well as the wearing of elaborate make-up and full-length traditional costume that leaves no skin showing from the neck down. The rigours that dan specialists historically endured in training were featured in “Farewell My Concubine”, an award-winning Chinese film released in 1993 (and withdrawn two weeks later by prudish censors who allowed its re-release only after some references to homosexuality were cut). The film portrayed the ordeal of a dan performer, from the 1920s when boys were often selected for such roles at an early age, to the puritanical era of Mao Zedong. The protagonist finds himself confused by the reality of his biological sex and the feelings he harbours for his male co-star. In Mr Xi’s China it is hard to imagine such a film being made, let alone shown. Dan acting is fine, but art that explores gender identity or sexual orientation is not. Mr Wang says he is straight and asserts that most Chinese men who earn money from cross-dressing simply want to “beat women at their own game”. On WeChat, a Chinese messaging service, Mr Wang maintains a chat-group for dan enthusiasts. He often tells them to keep their “private inclinations” a secret. “Our society still doesn’t accept two men holding hands and kissing in public, so you shouldn’t do it,” he says. But Mr Wang and his internet followers are not actors in traditional opera. They are drag artists who merely don elaborate dan costumes for effect—a nod to tradition that seems enough to keep the party happy. Some go further and undergo plastic surgery to acquire features associated with feminine beauty, such as wide eyes, a sharp jawline or a high-bridged nose. In his shows, Mr Wang often aims to shock. A typical routine involves luring his audience into thinking he is a woman, then delivering a punchline in a manly voice. Mr Wang is dismissive of men who still look male in drag: they are simply yi zhuangpi, or transvestites, he says pejoratively. Such views help Mr Wang to thrive in the cultural chill. His female persona, Wang Shangrong, has over 670,000 fans on TikTok, a popular live-streaming platform. Many of them are female. He says there may be thousands of drag performers in China who engage in his type of politically correct cross-dressing. Risks attend those who wear risqué garb. Last year a video went viral of three men in revealing drag being accosted by police in the eastern city of Suzhou. Many online comments on it supported the cross-dressers, but Mr Wang says the police were justified since the men were still identifiable as male. “If I’m mocked, it’s because my feminine beauty isn’t convincing enough,” he says. “Once we raise the standards of our performance, nobody will dare to bully us.” ■
