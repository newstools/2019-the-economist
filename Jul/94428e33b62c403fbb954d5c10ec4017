OUR TRANSATLANTIC podcast collaboration, “The Secret History of the Future”, is back for a second season. Tom Standage of The Economist and Seth Stevenson of Slate unearth curious tales hidden in the history of technology, and ask what they can tell us about the future. From the creation of the first computer program, to the quest for infallible crime-fighting forensics, to the etiquette of romance over the telegraph, these historical yarns can illuminate our present technological conundrums and offer cautionary lessons about the future. Change your perception of the past, and your understanding of human nature, by discovering the secret history of the future.  The first episode of season 2 considers the relationship between technology and music. The 19th-century invention of the phonograph left composers worried they might not be paid for recordings. The 20th-century proliferation of digital sampling made old copyright laws look obsolete. Can these previous disruptions of the music business teach us how to handle a 21st-century onslaught of computers that can compose their own songs?
