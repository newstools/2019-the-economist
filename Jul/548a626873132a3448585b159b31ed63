The Volunteer. By Jack Fairweather. Custom House; 529 pages; $28.99. WH Allen; £20. WITOLD PILECKI is one of the great—perhaps the greatest—unsung heroes of the second world war. He volunteered to be infiltrated into Auschwitz and spent two and a half years there, not only surviving but organising an extensive resistance network. Among other feats, he chronicled the murders and tortures meted out to the inmates, and the transformation of a modest internment and labour camp into the giant centrepiece of Hitler’s extermination of the Jews. His first-hand accounts were smuggled to the Polish government-in-exile in London, from which they reached the British and American leadership.  It would be nice to think two things. One is that the allies reacted speedily to the news by doing everything they could to halt the murder machine—bombing the camp and the rail lines that supplied it, arming the Polish underground army so that it could co-ordinate with the resistance inside Auschwitz over a mass break-out, and highlighting the plight of the Jews in occupied Europe as one of the greatest humanitarian crimes of all time. Another consoling assumption would be that after the war Pilecki’s courage, determination and ingenuity would be celebrated, not only in his native Poland, but everywhere. On both scores, think again. The news about Auschwitz trickled out slowly. One agent took over six months to make the hazardous journey to Britain. The stories were initially dismissed as fanciful, or, later, overshadowed by reports of other atrocities, such as the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto. President Franklin Roosevelt worried that publicising Auschwitz would stoke anti-Semitism—that Americans would believe Nazi propaganda that the war was being waged on behalf of the Jews. Military commanders thought attacking Auschwitz would be a distraction, and that the bombs and planes were needed for the only task that mattered, defeating Hitler (a leading British sceptic of targeting the camp was Charles Portal, chief of the air staff, and this reviewer’s great-uncle). Nor, alas, was Pilecki treated as a hero by Poland’s post-war communist regime. His resistance activities, under the direction of the émigré leadership in London, led to his arrest and torture—which was so bad, he told his family, that Auschwitz was “just a game” in comparison. His work fighting the Nazis counted for nothing in this new tyranny. He was executed on May 25th 1948; his body has never been found. Jack Fairweather’s meticulous and insightful book is likely to be the definitive version of this extraordinary life (even if, slightly jarringly, he calls his subject by his first name, Witold). The author, a British former foreign correspondent now living in America, has tracked down survivors, unearthed archival documents and obtained family papers. He has woven them together with Pilecki’s own powerful accounts, written after his escape from Auschwitz in 1943, to draw a sympathetic and imaginative picture of wartime Poland under Nazi occupation. The book is all the more powerful for the restraint with which he describes Nazi atrocities and Western shilly-shallying. And it is all the more welcome for its projection of an often-missed view of the war, in which Poles take a leading and positive role, rather than being mere bystanders, victims or accomplices. The maps and pictures are illuminating. This is not, as its publicity bumf claimed, “the first account” of an “untold story”. In fact, Pilecki’s deeds are already the subject of films, much journalism and many books, mostly in Polish but also in English and Italian. For his part, though, the author scrupulously cites these sources in his admirably comprehensive notes. He ends the book by reiterating Pilecki’s frustration that he had failed to deliver his message effectively. Then, as now, non-Western stories and viewpoints are all too often overlooked. ■
