Three Women. By Lisa Taddeo. Simon & Schuster; 320 pages; $27. Bloomsbury Circus; £16.99. IN THE EARLY 1970s Gay Talese set out to record the evolution of America’s sexual mores. Nine years of immersive research led to “Thy Neighbour’s Wife”, in which he wove histories of pornography and obscenity law with lurid tales of sex gurus and swingers. The book was a sensation even before its publication in 1981.  Much has changed since. The AIDS crisis led to discussions of safe sex; a new wave of feminism decried discrimination. Americans have become more accepting of premarital and same-sex relationships. After reporting on “halfway-hookers” in VIP nightclubs for New York Magazine in 2010, Lisa Taddeo decided to write an updated “Thy Neighbour’s Wife”, only “from a woman’s perspective”. Mr Talese focused on male fantasies and needs; Ms Taddeo spent eight years with three women in Rhode Island, Indiana and North Dakota. She intends them to “stand for the whole of what longing in America looks like”. The subjects of “Three Women” contradict Mr Talese’s claim that “the initiators were nearly always men and the inhibitors were nearly always women”. Sloane (not her real name), a glamorous restaurateur, has always enjoyed “messing around” with men and women; that her husband likes to watch is the talk of their small town. Lina, a stay-at-home mother of two young children, longs for her husband’s touch: “it’s as though [she] is living with a room-mate.” Her passion finds an outlet in roadside rendezvous with Aidan, an old boyfriend she re-encounters on Facebook. At 16 Maggie fell in love with her high-school teacher, Aaron. They stole illicit moments after class or in cars, until his wife found a compromising text message. Ms Taddeo spent time in these women’s home towns to better grasp their lives, and she writes about them with sensitivity. She has a novelist’s interest in small details: how the whiff of Aidan’s preferred beer is associated by Lina with “pure passion”; Maggie’s raddled copy of “Twilight”, her favourite book, which is sprayed with her teacher’s cologne and filled with his notes. Rather than dealing in cheap titillation, the author crafts engaging narratives. The reader first meets Maggie in court—years after the event, she has reported Aaron for corrupting her as a minor. Sloane’s cool adult demeanour is juxtaposed with her adolescent eating disorders and her emotionally stifled upbringing. “Three Women” captures the pain and powerlessness of desire as well as its heady joys. Still, the abiding impression is not of the subjects’ candour, nor their lust, nor even of the abuse that, one way or another, all three have suffered. Rather it is a sense that, for all the freedoms women have won, female desire is often still considered unruly and unacceptable, even repulsive. The sort of names some women call Sloane behind her back—slut, tart, whore—they say to Maggie’s face. Lina’s acquaintances are sympathetic about her failing marriage but scornful of her affair. “I set out to register the heat and sting of female want,” Ms Taddeo reflects, “so that men and other women might more easily comprehend before they condemn.” ■
