OUR TRANSATLANTIC podcast collaboration, “The Secret History of the Future”, is back for a second season. Tom Standage of The Economist and Seth Stevenson of Slate unearth curious tales hidden in the history of technology, and ask what they can tell us about the future. For thousands of years we sailed our cargo across oceans using zero-emission, 100 percent renewable wind. Then we switched to ships that run on oil, creating a global maritime fleet that pumps greenhouse gases into the sky. Could we go back to wind-powered ships by rediscovering a clever nautical innovation that we abandoned a century ago?
