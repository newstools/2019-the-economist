FLORIAN HENCKEL VON DONNERSMARCK hoped never to make a film about the Third Reich. Anne McElvoy asks the Oscar-winning director of “The Lives of Others” what changed his mind. His new film, “Never Look Away”, was inspired by the life of Gerhard Richter, an artist who unwittingly married the daughter of an SS doctor responsible for the death of his aunt. Mr Von Donnersmarck responds to criticisms of the film from Mr Richter, and from those who say he stylises violence. And they examine how his nation's relationship with the past shapes European politics today. Runtime: 21 min    Listen on: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Stitcher | TuneIn
