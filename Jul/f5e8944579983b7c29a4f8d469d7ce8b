The Economist is looking to hire a staff writer to cover British economics. Journalistic experience is not necessary: the last few people to do this job had not been journalists before they arrived at the paper. The ability to write clearly and entertainingly is, however, crucial. So is the ability to spot intriguing patterns in data. We test for these things mostly by asking for a sample article, which applicants should send, with a CV to: britaineconomicsjob@economist.com. Please write up to 700 words. Your article could be on some aspect of British macro- or microeconomics, or on political economy. Four recent examples follow.  The job is based in London, but the successful candidate need not be British. The deadline is August 4th. Example articles: Sterling’s depreciation has not led to an export boomFour years after its steelworks shut, Redcar is recoveringWhy British housebuilders are making such juicy profitsHigher interest rates could hit Britain’s vulnerable economy
