EVERY SUMMER tourists in London head to Westminster to see parliament’s famous clock tower, commonly known as Big Ben, for the bell inside. For the past two years, however, they have come away disappointed. The tower is shrouded in scaffolding as the crumbling parliament buildings undergo overdue repairs. The British government is disintegrating, too. On August 1st the Conservatives, led by a prime minister of nine days standing, lost a seat in a by-election in Wales. That result cut Boris Johnson’s working majority—the lead that his government and its allies hold over opposition parties—to just a single MP.  The Tories, who hold power thanks to an agreement with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, have now lost six MPs to by-elections and defections in 2019, the highest rate of attrition in decades. Theoretically, the government could fall if a single rebel Tory MP should turn against their party in a “no-confidence vote”. The government’s precarious state might persuade Mr Johnson to call a general election. That would probably become a plebiscite on Brexit, something the prime minister has promised to deliver by October 31st, deal or no deal. Should he choose to limp on, though, some simple arithmetic offers a clue as to the length of time his government’s majority might last. Since 1975 a by-election caused either by death or scandal has occurred every four months, on average. Recent polls put the Tories in a broad four-way split between Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the new Brexit party. Any forthcoming by-election in a Tory-held seat could sound the death-knell.
