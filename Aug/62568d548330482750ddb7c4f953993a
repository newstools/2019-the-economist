Joe Country. By Mick Herron. Soho Crime; 360 pages; $26.95. John Murray; £14.99. A SERIES OF comic thrillers about failed spies may seem an unlikely source of insight into modern Britain. And, in fact, Mick Herron’s six novels about a fictitious dumping-ground for errant British agents called Slough House do not aspire to documentary realism. “Authenticity is not what I’m seeking,” the author says, in a museum café near his home in Oxford. “Plausibility and broad-stroke reality is what I’m after.” Yet, in their gleefully shocking way, his books reflect the trajectory of the nation. Their jaundiced characters are the anti-heroes Brexit-era Britain deserves.  None of Mr Herron’s growing band of devotees can, for instance, have failed to notice that this reality includes a portrait—sustained across the series—of a ruthlessly ambitious politician named Peter Judd. “Public buffoon and private velociraptor”, the jovial, Latin-spouting Judd—“a loose cannon with a floppy haircut and a bicycle”—weaves through the vicissitudes of public life. “Straddling the gap between media-whore and political beast”, he charms, bluffs and schemes his way towards the peaks of power. Meanwhile, “below the surface lay a temper that could scorch chrome”. In the first book, “Slow Horses” (published in 2010), a journalist sketches out a path to Downing Street for Judd that relies on nativism, since “the decent people of this country are sick to death of being held hostage by mad liberals in Brussels.” Mr Herron insists that Judd “was created as a composite character made up of all the worst possible attributes that a politician could have.” He does not write romans à clef, and, indeed, politicians are not his stories’ focus. They barge in only to aggravate the lower-level debacles that punctuate routine in the “administrative oubliette” of squalid, shambolic Slough House. Yet few contemporary British writers possess keener antennae for the background hum of public affairs. Drily, Mr Herron notes that “the political chaos we’ve entered is playing nicely into the books I’ve written.” In the latest, the just-published “Joe Country”, Diana Taverner—the Machiavellian chief of Mr Herron’s fictionalised version of MI5, Britain’s domestic security service—considers: “If you want your enemy to fail, give him something important to do.” This strategy, the reader learns, is known “for obscure historical reasons” as “The Boris”. From their origins a century ago, in the era of John Buchan and Somerset Maugham, British spy novels have held up a cracked and smudged mirror to their times. In fiction, the twilit intrigues of Her Majesty’s secret services have tracked the course of imperial decline, the intelligence triumphs of the second world war and the ambiguous stalemate of the cold war. Since that struggle’s end, an assorted cast of jihadists, rogue states and crooked multinationals have assumed the adversary’s role in espionage fiction. In Mr Herron’s work, by contrast, the most vicious enemies lurk within—among colleagues, bosses, former allies, even family. “Essentially, I’m writing office politics,” he says. Manda Scott, author most recently of “A Treachery of Spies”, notes that the internecine savagery of Mr Herron’s security agencies finally buries the espionage-fiction myth of “decent gentlemen—public schoolboys all—upholding the values of imperial England by dint of superior intelligence”. Mr Herron, she says, broke the old boundaries by introducing a set-up in which the spies serve “venal politicians with no values other than the grabbing of power and survival”. He leavens this sardonic disenchantment with a dark seam of comedy, in meticulously sculpted prose. He is “a master of timing, word by word, sentence by sentence,” says Andrew Taylor, a crime novelist. “His language creates its own world, with streaks of satire and loss.” In a solemn genre, “it’s refreshing to find a series that makes you regularly laugh out loud.” Mr Taylor reckons that spy fiction may at last have found an author who will move it beyond the formidable legacy of John le Carré, its master craftsman. For his part, Mr Herron thinks of himself as an outsider in the world of espionage. After all, “so many writers of spy fiction are writing from a certain kind of knowledge”, either as former practitioners (like Mr le Carré) or as journalists. Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, he studied in Oxford and stayed there, working as an editor for a London legal publisher. After four Oxford-set mysteries, he devised Slough House and decided, “I like this world. I’m going to stay in it.” Some of the conflicts explored by Mr le Carré—a writer he reveres—endure among his downbeat rejects: “My characters are mired in the past. The big beasts among them are cold-war relics.” Permanent East-West tension is to them the natural state of affairs; history shapes their present. “Sudden events that blind us with their light”, thinks one elderly spymaster, “had roots in the slowly turning decades.” Looming over each twisting plot is Jackson Lamb, the scruffy and flatulent Falstaff of the undercover world. This dinosaur spook, once based in Berlin, runs his “crew of misfits” with a heavy yet protective hand. An “overweight, greasy has-been”, Lamb is a grotesque and a flawed champion. Mr Herron stresses that “I’m not into wish-fulfilment. I don’t think a bunch of heroes will save society.” Lamb, though, will cross almost any line to save his own agents. Even they, sociopathic losers and charmless geeks alike, strive to do the decent thing. “There’s a level of romance operating there,” he admits. “Their frustrations and thwarted desires come from wanting to do good.” Cynicism and hypocrisy intensify the higher readers ascend on Mr Herron’s ladder of power. External threats—far-right thugs, rogue veterans, even North Korean honeytraps—do impinge on Lamb’s shabby domain. When Brexit begins to loom over the clandestine affairs of an “increasingly isolated island state”, espionage by and against other European powers comes to the fore. Mostly, though, Mr Herron’s dysfunctional crew suffers from a sort of auto-immune condition. Their closed community generates toxic antibodies that devour it from within. The self-inflicted chaos, suspicion and inertia—and the brutal self-interest that lurks beneath—acidly capture the national mood. Although their comic zest seldom falters, the topical bite of the books has sharpened. “Joe Country”, in which one of Lamb’s underlings imagines a country led by Judd as “a mash-up of ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ and ‘It’s a Knockout’” (a notoriously puerile British game-show), feels like the bleakest volume yet. Its gags still sparkle. The stage, however, darkens. “As a human being, and a citizen of this country, I deplore almost everything that’s going on in public life,” Mr Herron says. “As a novelist with a bent towards the satirical, it’s a gift.” ■
