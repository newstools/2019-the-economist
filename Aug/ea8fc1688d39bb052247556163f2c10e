THE BALKANS have been described as a region that produces more history than it can absorb. About Georgia—another craggy, contested place—it might be said that there is a chronic surplus of culture. Start with indigenous traditions such as epic poetry and polyphonic singing; then factor in the ability of Georgians to master cultural forms born elsewhere, including theatre and classical music. When Georgia was pickled in Soviet aspic, those gifts were a lifeline to the world. Its theatre and film directors, with their quietly subversive messages, were revered across the Soviet Union. To Western audiences, they were a reminder that not all was drab in the communist bloc. Now that Georgia is a democracy, many of its artists thrive abroad yet retain close ties to their homeland. Amid the chaos after the Soviet collapse, Luka Okros, now a 28-year-old pianist, startled his parents by showing signs of genius at the age of four. He trained in Moscow and is now based in London, interpreting Liszt, Chopin and Rachmaninov in concert halls around the world, and—like other expatriate maestros—giving at least one big recital a year in Tbilisi.  But for all the sophistication of Georgia’s capital, there is still a gap between the atmosphere of diaspora communities and the cultural mores of the old country, where the Orthodox church is dominated by ultra-conservatives and has a violent fringe. The reception of a Georgian-language film that deals with a gay romance has brought that divide into focus. “And Then We Danced” drew a standing ovation at Cannes in May and has since won praise and prizes across Europe; it will be screened in London and Paris in the near future. But the Georgian authorities, who usually encourage film-making in the country’s ancient, expressive tongue, have kept their distance and refused to provide any funding. In Georgia’s homophobic climate, the shooting of the film—about an affair between two young male dancers—had to be semi-clandestine, says Levan Akin, a Swede of Georgian origin and the title’s director. Mr Akin calls the film a love-letter to Georgia, which he often visited as a child. Unlike many of today’s young Georgians, who prefer techno to tradition, he adores the indigenous heritage. But he feels it must be liberated from its self-appointed guardians: people like the film’s steely dance teacher who insists, implausibly, that there is nothing sensual about the gyrations he demands. Mr Akin was inspired to make the movie after reading in 2013 that a gay-pride event in Tbilisi had been harassed by thugs and zealots. (The hand of Russia, which occupies a chunk of the country, may lurk behind such ructions.) Towards the film’s end there is a funny, touching exchange between Merab, a dancer and the hero (pictured right), and his boozy, just-married brother David. “I’ll just be another fat, drunk Georgian…and that’s fine,” says David. “But you, Merab, are special and that’s why you must leave Georgia now.” For their part, the dancer-actors who play Merab and Irakli, his partner in a fleeting, passionate relationship, are adamant that they will not emigrate. Both Levan Gelbakhiani and Bachi Valishvili (left) say they will stay and fight for a more tolerant society. “When there’s a leak in your home you don’t leave, you fix it,” says Mr Valishvili. That is brave, given the hate mail (roughly balanced by fan mail) that they have received from compatriots. In the main, spiky ideas—as well as people—slide backwards and forwards between Georgia and the world with an ease that would astound a Soviet time-traveller. David Papava, for example, left home in the 1990s and made a name as a director of experimental theatre in London, before returning to Tbilisi. His rendering of Aristophanes’s comedy, “The Birds”, took digs at the country’s extravagant political class. “Some critics didn’t like my work,” Mr Papava recalls, “but I never felt threatened.” Many censorious old habits have waned—but some endure. ■
