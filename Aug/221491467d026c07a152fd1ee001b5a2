WENDELL PIERCE, best known for his roles in the television dramas “The Wire”, “Suits” and “Jack Ryan”, plays Willy Loman in a new production of “Death of a Salesman” which is moving to London’s West End this autumn. Anne McElvoy caught up with him backstage before a performance in July and asked him whether casting an all-black Loman family changes the nature of the play. Mr Pierce also talks about his most famous roles and his beloved hometown New Orleans, as well as his thoughts on America’s troubled racial history and how that history shapes his views of the current president of the United States.
