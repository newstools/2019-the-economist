Legacy: One Family, A Cup of Tea and the Company that Took on the World. By Thomas Harding. William Heinemann; 592 pages; £25. A FAMILY IS a little kingdom, Samuel Johnson noted, and in the mercantile principality of Gluckstein and Salmon, the heraldic emblem might have been a sheaf of sticks. A father hands his sons some twigs, Monte Gluckstein once told his nephew, drawing on Aesop’s fable. Break one, the father orders. They do. He bundles the sticks. Now break them, he says. L’union fait la force—“Strength in unity”—was the family motto, explained Monte, third-generation scion of a catering empire.  Thomas Harding mined the traumatic history of his father’s family in Germany in “The House by the Lake”. In “Legacy” he explores his maternal lineage—an arc spanning five generations from immigrants to tycoons. The Glucksteins and Salmons founded Lyons, a firm that shaped British tastes, catered for Buckingham Palace and owned a hit parade of mega-brands. The saga was launched by the flight of a young Hebrew teacher named Lehmann Gluckstein from eastern Europe in the early 1800s, and took root in London where his son Samuel created a small cigar factory. In 1886 Monte, Samuel’s heir and the family visionary, applied the lessons of tobacco manufacturing to catering. J. Lyons and Company was named after a less-Yiddische partner to put off anti-Semites. Thanks to showmanship and an instinct for popular taste, the operation expanded. Lyons fulfilled the largest catering contract in history—8m meals served at the British Empire Exposition of 1924-25. It owned the biggest hotel and ice-cream plant in Europe and the largest tea-packing facility in the world (when Lehmann was growing up, Jews were forbidden to trade in tea, sugar and coffee). It developed the first business computer. Family always came first. As did men: the board, Mr Harding ruefully notes, never included women. They were absent, as well, from Monte’s funeral in 1922. Custom cautioned that wealthy women could not “restrain their emotions”. Mature British readers will associate the Lyons name with tea shops and Corner Houses (the Starbucks of their time), from which white-aproned waitresses, known as Nippies, made it into the Oxford English Dictionary. The ingredients of success were quality, value, efficiency and food that was consistent down to the carefully calibrated jam in Swiss rolls—Henry Ford applied to comestibles. Mr Harding’s affectionate family story is deftly sandwiched in the rise and fall of empire, two world wars, and two centuries of social and political change. A refitted Lyons factory made many of the bombs dropped on Germany in the second world war. Despite the chauvinism at head office, Lyons tea shops are said to have contributed to female emancipation by providing a safe entry to social life and consumerdom. Previously, male-dominated pubs had been practically the only places for many women to order drinks. In the end, the sticks threatened to fall apart. A younger generation caught conglomeration fever and binged on acquisitions, adding Baskin-Robbins, an American ice-cream chain, and continental meat-processors. Overreach and spectacularly bad timing—involving an oil crisis, a recession and a sinking pound—brought Lyons to the brink of insolvency. The hotels were sold and then, in 1978, the company itself. But the denouement, a delicate business complicated by lots of heirs, was managed “with care and honour”, Mr Harding writes, and with “friendly relationships intact”. Monte’s bundle held fast. ■
