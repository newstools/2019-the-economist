The Need. By Helen Phillips. Simon & Schuster; 272 pages; $26. Chatto & Windus; £16.99. MOST PALAEOBOTANISTS plug away with little fanfare. But Molly’s years at a particular quarry have yielded some eye-opening finds. Besides countless fossils that defy known records, she has stumbled on a small toy soldier with a tail, a Coca-Cola bottle with cockeyed font and, most thrilling of all, a Bible in which God is female.  These novelties have turned the quiet pit where she works into a buzzing destination for curious tourists and a few religious fanatics. Some come to deliver threats; others send their venom by mail. Molly has taken all this in her stride. But when a mysterious woman arrives at Molly’s home one night, while she is alone with her two small children, everything starts to unravel. She is forced to confront a mother’s deepest fears. “The Need” by Helen Phillips, a critically acclaimed but underexposed American novelist, is an enthralling book. With its short chapters, unsettling prose and riveting suspense, it feels designed for binge-reading. But keep an eye on the clock. Immersion in this novel before bedtime is a recipe for sleeplessness. Part of the appeal is Ms Phillips’s stylish mode of storytelling. She creates momentum with brief and often enigmatic scenes, which she strips of all but the most evocative details. The chapters often toggle between moments of heightened drama and past scenes of Molly at work, which is a nicely disorienting way to build tension while delivering expository details. Although the story is told in the third person, readers are very much inside Molly’s head. It vibrates with the kind of neurotic self-recrimination typical of exhausted and ambitious working mothers who find themselves “caught in the cyclone” of their children’s needs. Molly’s breastmilk invariably comes down at moments of high emotion, which not only dampens her bra but reminds her that she is also, essentially, an animal. Why doesn’t Molly call her beloved husband, who is travelling for work, to explain what is going on? Should her milk be coming in with such vigour when her baby is eating solid foods? Such artistic liberties are excusable. Molly’s leaky breasts show just how primal the bond between parents and children can be. Given the fierceness of that devotion, the potential for horror is nearly endless.
