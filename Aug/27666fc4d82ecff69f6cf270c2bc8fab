THE REMARKABLE thing about the fall of the Italian government this week was that it did not happen sooner. Parties that depict themselves as outsiders, such as the Northern League and the Five Star Movement (M5S), typically find their first stint in office a fiasco. A coalition of two such outfits, one a hard-right nativist group and the other an eclectic set of economic populists, greens and internet utopians, was bound to come unglued. Moreover, whereas the M5S finished first in last year’s election, the League has since far surpassed it, polling at 37% to the M5S’s 17%. The League’s leader, Matteo Salvini, has proved more astute than the M5S’s Luigi di Maio. It is not surprising that he pulled his support from Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, in a bid to trigger an election and win the job for himself. Just now, however, an election would be a grave mistake for Italy and Europe. That might seem unfair. After all, the composition of parliament does not reflect public opinion. But this is a precarious moment for Italy (see article). Its economy is feeble, with growth this year expected to be just 0.1%. Its immense government debt, of more than 130% of GDP, is the greatest single threat to the euro zone. An election would take months, threatening Italy’s efforts to pass a budget by the end of the year. That could upset markets at a time when much of Europe is already on the edge of recession.  Should the pro-Kremlin, anti-immigrant Mr Salvini win a vote, he would seek clashes with the European Union over refugee settlement and foreign policy—a distraction when the public finances are at stake. Worse, the European Commission must review Italy’s budget to ensure that it deals with the country’s debt. A proposal is due on October 15th. When the previous government’s initial draft of last year’s budget was rejected by Brussels, it led to months of haggling. Mr Salvini’s promises of tax cuts suggest that any government he leads will face similar problems. A second reason to delay lies in Rome. Mr Salvini has spent the past year relentlessly undercutting and upstaging the M5S. On some issues, such as the conflict over a high-speed-rail tunnel that precipitated the fall of the government, the M5S and the League are diametrically opposed. Mr di Maio deserves a chance to show whether his party can govern. Rather than stage an election, the M5S should form a new coalition with the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) and independent lawmakers. A temporary, less rivalrous coalition with the PD could give voters time to get a better sense of the M5S’s abilities before they pass judgment. More important, such a government could pass a compromise budget, and then hold elections early next year. A coalition would face the daunting task of finding spending cuts of €23bn, equivalent to 1.3% of GDP, to avert steep value-added-tax rises. It may well exceed deficit rules, as Mr Salvini surely would. But, by putting off the election for later, it would gain time to talk to the EU. It will not be easy for the M5S and PD to work together. Mr di Maio will have to overcome his party’s reluctance to join one of the traditional parties it has vowed to supplant. The PD is even more divided. Matteo Renzi, its former leader, favours a coalition. Nicola Zingaretti, the current one, is sceptical. The party has set out five reasonable conditions for collaboration, such as the M5S renouncing anti-EU rhetoric. But Mr Zingaretti has also insisted on a clear-cut break with the past, which could be a veiled attempt to exclude Mr di Maio from the next cabinet. If such demands force new elections, it would be a mistake. This is not the time for Italy to play political games. ■
