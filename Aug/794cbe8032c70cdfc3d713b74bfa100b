WALK DOWN any high street in Britain and you find no shortage of shops advertising e-cigarettes, which have seemingly exploded in popularity in recent years. Public-health officials are worried. Little is known about the long-term health effects of vaping, and many have accused e-cigarette manufacturers of aiming their products at children. Yet, newly released data suggest that concerns over e-cigarettes’ popularity among youngsters may be overblown, at least in England. A report from the National Health Service (NHS) finds that only around 6% of English pupils aged 11 to 15 say they use e-cigarettes, virtually unchanged from 2016. Just 2% of the 13,000 pupils surveyed said they are “regular” users, also unchanged from three years ago. A separate study, also from the NHS, finds that the share of British adults who report regularly vaping has stayed flat since 2015. Demand for e-cigarettes started to grow rapidly in Britain in the early 2010s, but appears to be levelling off.  One of the biggest worries policymakers have about e-cigarettes is that they might cause more teens to become addicted to nicotine, and subsequently take up smoking. This, too, appears to not be the case. NHS data show that only around 5% of teens say they smoke today, roughly the same proportion who said they did so in 2016, and far below the share who said they did so in 1982. There are plenty of reasons to worry about “kids these days”, but nicotine use is not one of them.
