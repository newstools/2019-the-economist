Find Me. By André Aciman. Farrar, Straus & Giroux; 272 pages; $26. Faber & Faber; £14.99 IN 2017, LUCA GUADAGNINO’S acclaimed film adaptation of “Call Me By Your Name” alerted a wider audience to the fiction of André Aciman. His debut novel, adapted by Mr Guadagnino with an Oscar-winning screenplay by James Ivory, framed a poignant same-sex romance against an Italian Riviera backcloth and a tissue of elegiac reflections on desire, destiny and the passage of time.  ��Find Me” revisits the story of Elio, a 17-year-old student in the first book, and Oliver, the summer guest who briefly became Elio’s lover before returning to America and heterosexual marriage. The Egyptian-born Mr Aciman, a devotee of Marcel Proust who teaches in New York, has a character tell the reader that “nothing belongs to the past”. But neither does the past simply echo in the present. Rather, “fate works forward, backward, and crisscrosses sideways”. So “Find Me” refuses to offer a straightforward sequel to its much-admired forerunner. This may exasperate some fans of the earlier work. The book has four unequal sections. Each bears a musical title and all are set—in Rome, Paris and New York— many years after the early-1980s trysts that made Elio and Oliver into lifelong, though separated, soulmates. “Tempo” shows Elio’s widowed father Sami, an urbane classicist, overwhelmed by his own erotic bolt from the blue. He meets a stranger on a train, a much younger photographer called Miranda, and the mutually smitten pair decide to seize the day. Mr Aciman’s people long to defy age and time, that “wobbly, unreliable metaphor for how we think about life”, even as time snaps at their elegantly-shod heels. They want life to “taste of something as real as blood”, and to wipe out their “wasted and barren years” of loneliness. Yet Mr Aciman’s well-upholstered prose, his polished, aphoristic dialogue and discreetly luxurious surroundings, often distance the reader from the raw passions that propel his tales. The adult Elio reappears in “Tempo”, then narrates the Paris-based “Cadenza”. Now a successful pianist, still yearning for Oliver, he meets a debonair older lawyer, Michel, who owns an ancestral château that “wasn’t [Evelyn Waugh’s] Brideshead but it wasn’t [EM Forster’s] Howards End either”. Elio’s headlong cross-generation romance mirrors his father’s. As before, Mr Aciman courageously refuses to lock love in neat boxes marked with approved labels. Michel attracts with his worldly “blend of wisdom, irony, and just a dab of sadness”—as does the author at his best. The narrative shifts to Manhattan, where in “Capriccio” the middle-aged Oliver, an academic, gets crushes on his younger colleagues (both male and female). He feels trapped in his humdrum marriage and, inevitably, dreams of Elio. Can he redress “the one mistake that threw your life off course”? Possibly, although the closing “Da Capo” will make clear “the price we pay for the unlived life”. “Find Me” dwells on incomplete, unfinished lives. Its splintered form mimics this theme. But these crabwise movements can frustrate the reader as much as fate impedes the star-crossed lovers. Their regrets and longings, though artfully couched in the “tone of nostalgic resignation verging on melancholy” that Elio finds in Michel’s speech, too seldom break through the tasteful decor to truly touch the heart.
