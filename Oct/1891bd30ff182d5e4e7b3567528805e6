DESPITE A LONG run of profitability and the longest economic expansion on record, the mood in corporate America is darkening. The latest survey of leading chief executives by the Conference Board, a research group, shows confidence plunging. Citing trade conflict and a slowing global economy, these bosses are scaling back plans for capital investment and hiring. That gloom is reflected in forecasts for the third-quarter earnings season, which is now in full swing. David Kostin of Goldman Sachs expects the profitability of companies in the S&P 500 stockmarket index to decline by some 4% on average, compared with the same quarter last year. If the volatile energy sector is excluded, America Inc seems to be heading for its worst quarterly performance in a decade.  Nevertheless, profitability at the median American firm will still rise, argues Mr Kostin. A smallish number of goliaths that are dragging down the average. Among them are Apple, Exxon, Pfizer—and troubled Boeing, which on October 23rd reported that its profits had fallen by more than half, year on year. Technology giants are in a funk, both because the semiconductor cycle is in a downturn and because social-media and search firms face the threat of tighter privacy and antitrust regulation. One reason why the median firm’s profitability is still growing is that most American firms, even those with a global presence, earn most of their revenues at home. Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse observes that the drop in profitability appears more pronounced among the minority with strong global exposure. His analysis of big firms across sectors shows that earnings per share at domestically focused firms have risen this year while those at internationally focused ones have plunged. That suggests that if consumers keep spending, then most of corporate America should continue to prosper, despite geopolitical uncertainty.
