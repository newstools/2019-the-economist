AS GOVERNMENTS around the world update their policies towards the legality of cannabis, that drug’s medical and recreational use is spreading. Many women therefore want to know whether it is safe to take the stuff during pregnancy, and face a dearth of evidence to guide them. The use of cannabis by pregnant women is on the rise. A study in a Californian health-care system suggests uptake increased from 2.4% of pregnant mothers in 2002 to 3.9% in 2014. Other work in Western countries has found rates of between 3% and 16%. Such use is by no means simply recreational. Medical cannabis is employed in many places to control nausea and vomiting, so pregnant women have turned to it to treat morning sickness. Some groups would like to promote the use of cannabis during pregnancy as safe and beneficial. CannaMommy, a website which supports a mother’s right to choose “plants over pills” during pregnancy, thinks mothers-to-be should be able to decide how they medicate themselves. A banner across one video on the site says, “Fact: Cannabis is safer than pharmaceuticals”.  It isn’t a fact, however. The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. What evidence there is, moreover, is not encouraging. Some studies indicate that using cannabis during pregnancy has long-term consequences for the development of a baby’s brain. These investigations are observational, not double-blinded clinical trials, so they are not completely conclusive. However they suggest prenatal cannabis exposure predisposes people to hyperactivity, impulsivity, loss of attention, psychosis and increased sensitivity to drugs of abuse. A paper published this week in Nature Neuroscience examines these issues more systematically. Miriam Melis of the University of Cagliari, in Monserrato, Italy and her colleagues carried out experiments, albeit on rodents rather than people, that looked into the question of prenatal exposure to cannabis by administering the drug’s main psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to pregnant rats. THC interacts with the endocannabinoid system, a network of brain cells which communicate with each other using THC-like molecules. Neuroscientists’ concerns about using cannabis during pregnancy stem from the fact that, in developing brains, the endocannabinoid system directs cell growth, the differentiation of neurons and the way in which neurons grow, form junctions with each other and are pruned. Dr Melis administered low doses of THC (equivalent to a single, mild joint) to pregnant rats. She then looked at the behaviour and neurobiology of the offspring. One test happened in the third and fourth week after birth. A second was when the animals were older—an age roughly equivalent to the period just before adolescence in humans. Before the second test, the youngsters were given a dose of THC. Dr Melis found that exposing rat embryos to THC rewired the part of the brain that handles reward and motivation—but only in males. Neurons in this area were more excitable than those in control animals when stimulated by dopamine, another chemical that carries messages between neurons. They also fired off their electrical impulses at a higher frequency. In people, says Dr Melis, hyperactive dopamine neurons of this sort are a feature of vulnerability to a range of psychiatric disorders that include schizophrenia, mania and drug addiction. Another effect that Dr Melis detected was impaired “sensorimotor gating”. This is the way that a brain filters out superfluous information and prevents an overload of data. These underlying neurological changes did not, however, manifest themselves immediately as changes in behaviour. Instead, the rats concerned acted normally until given their preadolescence doses of THC. At this point their behaviour changed, as they became hyperactive and increasingly likely to take risks. Though it is sometimes hard to translate work done on rodents to human beings—particularly in this case, when only males seem affected—Dr Melis’s findings lend support to the conclusions of observational studies which suggest that prenatal exposure to cannabis leads to increased susceptibility to a range of mental health problems. There was one intriguing positive finding. The authors were able to correct their rats’ behavioural and neurological abnormalities by dosing them with pregnenolone, a drug currently undergoing tests for the treatment of cannabis addiction, schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder. But the long and short of the work done thus far is that consuming cannabis during pregnancy is far from safe. ■
