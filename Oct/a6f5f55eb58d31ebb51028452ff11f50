MOST MUSEUM exhibits are beautiful—or at least old. But an exhibition in 2015 at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) included 60 cardboard boxes of documents. The point was to give a sense of the scale of two of the body’s longest and largest legal disputes, over American and European subsidies for aircraft manufacturers. Now the fight is moving out of the paperwork phase. That means tariffs are coming. On October 2nd the WTO published its decision to allow the Trump administration to put tariffs on $7.5bn-worth of imports from the European Union. That is intended to match the harm done to Boeing, an American manufacturer, by the EU’s subsidies for Airbus, Boeing’s European rival. It is the largest retaliation the WTO has ever approved. Senior officials at the United States Trade Representative (USTR) called the victory “historic”.  The dispute has been long and bitter. In October 2004 America complained to the trade body about loans offered by EU governments to Airbus on easy terms. The following June the EU filed a complaint about the harm to Airbus from subsidies to Boeing, in the form of tax breaks and generous contracts with the Department of Defence. Since then there has been enough legal back-and-forth to bore the most ardent plane-spotter. The WTO ruled against both subsidisers. Each made some adjustments supposed to resolve the other’s complaints—but neither was satisfied. The latest judgment comes as the EU’s claim of compliance is still being assessed. In around eight months, the WTO is likely to authorise the EU to put tariffs on American imports, completing the tit for tat. In a narrow sense, this is the multilateral rules-based trading system working as intended. Both parties went through the proper channels to receive an official judgment. Neither took matters into its own hands. The tariffs America is about to impose on Europe are not unilateral bullying, but an enforcement mechanism of last resort. They would probably have been applied by any president, even one less tariff-happy than Donald Trump. In a broader sense, it shows how vulnerable those multilateral rules are to timewasters. In a sector like aircraft manufacturing, where subsidies are ubiquitous, it has always been clear that America and the EU needed to agree to mutual disarmament. Instead, they have talked past each other, each complaining at various points that the other was unwilling to negotiate. Most recently it has been the EU that has submitted proposals to America, only to be ignored. Meanwhile, the boxes have been piling up and the lawyers raking in fees. The Trump administration wasted no time in starting the formalities at the WTO that will allow it to apply the tariffs. That means the EU can expect tariffs on October 18th, of 10% on aircraft and 25% on agricultural and industrial goods. The USTR had already consulted on a roster of imports worth over $25bn last year, so it had plenty of choice. The list it published on October 2nd included, as expected, Italian parmesan, Scotch whisky and German waffles. Even if a product is not on the list it may still be hit, as items could be shuffled in and out. Perhaps in eight months’ time, when the WTO authorises the EU to place retaliatory tariffs on American imports as part of the Boeing dispute, the two sides will finally negotiate away their differences. And perhaps Mr Trump’s appetite for tariffs will have been sated, and he will abandon separate threats to put tariffs on European cars and car parts (which are not on the Airbus tariff list). But it is also possible that trade disputes between the two sides become fiercer. America is blocking the appointment of judges to the WTO’s court of appeals. If either side makes a move that the other judges an infraction, and a complaint to the WTO cannot be heard for lack of judges, that could be the end of playing by the rules.
