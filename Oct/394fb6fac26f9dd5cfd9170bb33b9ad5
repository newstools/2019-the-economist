Although parliament has so far rejected a general election, the parties are gearing up to fight one soon. Our poll tracker, which averages over a dozen pollsters, shows how the parties might fare.  The Economist’s poll-of-polls aggregates data from several firms using a statistical method called a generalized additive mixed model with smoothing. The model corrects for some pollsters’ tendency to consistently over- or under-estimate support for particular parties and reacts quickly to new data that reflects true changes in public opinion, while still treating individual outlier polls with caution.
