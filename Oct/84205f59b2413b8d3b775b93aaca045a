BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP with Europe dominated the last years of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership. Anne McElvoy asks Charles Moore, a Conservative columnist and her authorised biographer, whether the roots of Brexit can be traced back to the Iron Lady’s fierce tussles over British sovereignty. They talk about the machinations of her inner circle during her final years in power and her pioneering climate advocacy. Also, the “nightmare” of managing Boris Johnson, and what really happened at those louche Spectator lunches. Runtime: 26 min    Listen on: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Stitcher | TuneIn
