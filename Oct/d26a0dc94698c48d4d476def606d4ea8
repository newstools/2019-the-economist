AFTER DYING in his bed in 1975 General Francisco Franco, Spain’s dictator for 36 years, was buried in haste at the Valley of the Fallen, a grandiose monument on a mountainside outside Madrid that he built to celebrate his victory in the Spanish civil war. But his presence, in one of only two named tombs amid 34,000 anonymous war dead, is now seen as an aberration. On October 24th, in an operation organised by Pedro Sánchez, the Socialist prime minister, and attended by 22 of Franco’s descendants, his coffin was due to be dug up and then moved to a quiet public cemetery on the outskirts of the capital, where his wife lies. Mr Sánchez was carrying out a resolution of the Spanish parliament and a promise he made on becoming prime minister last year. It took more than a year to overcome legal objections from Franco’s family—who wanted to rebury him, prominently, in the crypt of Madrid’s cathedral—and the threatened disobedience of the Benedictine prior who administers the Valley. The Vatican slapped down the prior; last month the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the government could proceed.  “No enemy of democracy deserves a place of worship nor institutional respect,” Mr Sanchez said of the court ruling. More Spaniards agree with him than disagree. But the delay means the exhumation comes barely a fortnight before a general election, the fourth in as many years. The Socialists hope it will rally their faithful. Only Vox, a far-right party, actively opposes what it calls a “profanation” of Franco’s tomb. The conservative opposition would rather discuss the future. The Socialists want to turn the Valley into “a museum of memory”. Their opponents fear that would lead to the writing of history by one side again. Modern Spain is not in thrall to Franco’s ghost. Most Spaniards have no memory of him. But the country has yet to agree on the past. It may never do so.■
