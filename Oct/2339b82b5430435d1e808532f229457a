GEORGIA DEMOCRAT Stacey Abrams was the first African-American woman to win a major-party nomination for governor in 2018, narrowly losing to the incumbent she accused of suppressing non-white votes.

Also who would Abrams, as spy novelist, like to see in the role of James Bond? Runtime: 27 min    Listen on: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Stitcher | TuneIn
