This article contains plot details of season eight of “Game of Thrones” “WHEN YOU play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.” Cersei Lannister’s binary prediction, made eight years and 62 episodes ago during the first season of TV drama “Game of Thrones”, is looking prescient. With just four episodes left, a major battle looks set to wipe out many of the show’s remaining characters. And not all survivors would have much chance of taking a seat upon the Iron Throne as the ruler of Westeros when the final season ends, according to bookmakers.  Early front-runner Bran Stark, no stranger to falling, has plummeted from favour with bettors, while his sister Sansa’s chances have nearly doubled over the past two episodes. A new “battle of the bastards” is taking place between Gendry and Jon Snow in third and fourth place, even as the latter’s true heritage starts to cause problems with his beloved aunt. And as is fitting for a show with a meandering moral compass, the two players who most want to win, Cersei and Daenerys Targaryen, have little hope, at least if the wisdom of crowds is to be believed.
