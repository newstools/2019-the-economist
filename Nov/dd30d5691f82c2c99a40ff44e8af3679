THE MONTHS of street protest in Hong Kong have acquired some ritualistic aspects. One oft-repeated ceremony might be dubbed “the unfurling of the banner”. As confrontation looms, from the masked ranks of policemen two step forward holding aloft poles bearing a sign reading “Warning: Tear Smoke”, in Chinese and English. Shortly afterwards, the firing starts; and clouds of stinging, burning, choking gas-powder swirl. Aside from a hard-core few equipped with masks themselves, the crowd scatters, with the police in pursuit. Whatever differentiates the many protests around the world in recent months, most have faced this tactic from the authorities. Indeed, Hong Kong is a relatively modest user. In the first five months of protests, its police fired nearly 6,000 rounds of tear-gas. Data are sketchy, but that seems a fairly modest figure—far fewer, for example, than were used on just one day in Paris last December against gilets jaunes (yellow-jacket) protesters.  Tear-gas, for all its unpleasantness, often spares lives. Advocates say it reduces up-close violence that can turn nasty, with beatings and even the use of hand-guns; and helps security forces to disperse crowds without resort to more lethal methods, such as baton-rounds, rubber bullets or even live ammunition. In Hong Kong, it seems to have been remarkably successful at sparing lives, as protests have become increasingly bitter and violent. Only on November 8th did they lead to a fatality, when Alex Chow, a student, died in hospital after a fall from a ledge in a car park four days earlier, while fleeing tear-gas. By contrast, in Iraq, where the current protests began only in October, more than 300 people have died, largely because of the authorities’ greater willingness to use live ammunition. Even so tear-gas is controversial. Anna Feigenbaum, an academic at the University of Bournemouth and author of a book published in 2017 (“Tear Gas: From the Battlefields of World War I to the Streets of Today”), goes so far as to argue that it is “bad for democracy”. She says it “allows the threshold of acceptable violence to be lowered and so avoids a deliberative process.” Policemen armed with non-lethal tear-gas may be too ready to use it. Tear-gas is also, bizarrely, banned for military use, but not for civilian crowd-control. The term covers a range of chemicals, of which the most widely used include o‐chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS), oleoresin capsicum (OC, also known as pepper spray) and 1‐chloroacetophenone (CN). The gases are in fact powders, and new variants (CS1 and CS2) are “siliconised”, ie, given a shell that slows dispersal and makes them longer-lasting. All these owe their origins to experiments in the first world war. The French are generally credited with introducing tear-gas to the battlefield, as early as August 1914. The use of “asphyxiating, poisonous or other” gases in that war led to their banning under the 1925 Geneva Protocol. Armies sometimes skirted the prohibition—America, for example, made wide use of CS gas in the Vietnam war, on the authority of a presidential executive order. But the ban on the military use of tear-gas was also included in the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. After the first world war, it was in America and then the British empire that tear-gas became a popular “riot-control agent”. Indeed the Hong Kong police are following procedures devised before the second world war as British colonial administrators grappled with the question of how to justify the use of gas. One prerequisite, stipulated the War Office, was a “declared intention to use tear-gas and adequate warnings given to the opponents”. The use of the obfuscatory term “smoke” was also promoted. In the words of Henry Duffield Craik, governor of Punjab province under the British Raj from 1938 to 1941, “gas is a much more alarming term, as it suggests something resembling the poison gas used by the Germans in the last war.” The short-term effects of tear-gas are extremely unpleasant, but seem to wear off soon. Little is known about the long-term dangers. It is not a product that lends itself to clinical trials. But most observers agree that the dangers come more from the way it is misused than from the gas itself. Brian Castner, a weapons investigator for Amnesty International, a human-rights watchdog, says three conditions need to be met: that there is a way for a crowd to disperse; that the area is well ventilated; and that the tear-gas is fired into the ground in front of protesters, not in the air or at their heads—especially when the canisters holding the gas are large and potentially lethal, as in Iraq. Even if these guidelines are followed, and they often are not, a defining characteristic of tear-gas is that it is indiscriminate, as Rohini Haar of Physicians for Human Rights, another NGO, points out. It affects everybody in the vicinity. Indeed in Hong Kong it is estimated 88% of the population have been exposed to gas in recent weeks. That sample is bound to include people with asthma, lung disease, skin complaints and other ailments, for whom the effects of tear-gas are more severe. The use of tear-gas is, to say the least, riskier than it first appears.
