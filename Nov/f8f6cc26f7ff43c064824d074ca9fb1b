FOR 120 years RWE has been one of Europe’s biggest emitters of carbon dioxide. The German utility cleared almost all of Hambacher forest, a once-vast wood in western Germany, to mine lignite, an especially filthy fossil fuel, which it burned to generate electricity. What is left of “Hambi” has become a symbol of the anti-coal movement, occupied by activists camping in 80-odd tree houses. Greta Thunberg, a star teenage carbon critic, paid them a visit in August. RWE is under fire even where it does not operate. A Peruvian farmer has sued it in a German court for its contribution to climate change that led to the melting of an Andean glacier, which threatens to flood his home. He lost but is appealing. RWE’s ongoing battle with environmentalists, who have pelted its workers with stones and excrement, may soon be over. Or so hopes its boss, Rolf Martin Schmitz. In September the EU agreed to a €43bn ($47.5bn) asset swap between RWE and its rival E.ON. It turns E.ON into Europe’s largest power-grid operator by assets and RWE into the world’s second-biggest producer of offshore wind power and Europe’s third-biggest producer of renewable energy. Since then Mr Schmitz has promoted “the new RWE”. A glossy brochure proclaims a vow to become carbon neutral by 2040.  Sam Arie at UBS, a Swiss bank, sees promise in RWE Renewables, which rakes in gross operating profits of €1.5bn or so. Of the EU’s 28 members, 18 have pledged to emit no net carbon by 2050. Germany says it will stop using coal by 2038 and stump up €40bn to ease the transition. This should increase demand for renewables. But these same policies—and German politics—are creating uncertainty for RWE, says Mr Arie. RWE is demanding a chunk of the transition pot. It still runs three lignite mines, which directly employ 9,900 people and indirectly support another 20,000 jobs in the Rhine region. Mr Schmitz assumes most of the three gigawatts the government plans to phase out by 2023 will come from these mines. It may cost €1.2bn-1.5bn for every gigawatt—much less, he says, than the €28bn Germany spends each year on renewable-energy subsidies. In order to make his case, he shuttles several times a week from RWE’s headquarters in Essen to Berlin for talks with ministers. Resolving the standoff at “Hambi” could be especially expensive. Last October a court ordered a halt to the clearing of its remaining 200 hectares (a thirtieth of its original extent). Mr Schmitz says the forest could be left as it is—but at a price. It may cost the company €1.5bn or so to find an alternative to a planned expansion of an open-pit mine at Hambach. Investors have remained bullish on RWE, whose share price is up by a third this year. But Mr Schmitz is not quite out of the woods. This month RWE’S profit forecast for the renewables business undershot analysts’ estimates. Much hinges on those frequent trips to Berlin. Insiders describe the tone of the discussions as ruppig (gruff) at times. RWE says agreement is “not yet imminent”. It is hoping for one by the end of the year. With winter upon them, Hambach’s tree-huggers must be, too. ■
