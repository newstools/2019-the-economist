THE LINK between capitalism and progress is being questioned. Should big business step into the breach where politics is gridlocked? In a New York buzzing with world leaders and talk of impeachment, Anne McElvoy interviews Michael Bloomberg, the businessman, philanthropist and former mayor of the city. She asks him if CEOs are the new politicians and whether he thinks Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren has the edge in the White House race. Also, why even billionaires yearn to stop and smell the roses.
