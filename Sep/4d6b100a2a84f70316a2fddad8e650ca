TWO DECADES ago there were no gay men in China. That, at least, was the claim of a senior Chinese official when asked what proportion of his country’s HIV cases involved homosexual transmission. His questioner, a government minister visiting from Britain in 2000, offered her host a wager: £100 that there were, in fact, gay Chinese. “I note that he didn’t take the bet,” the minister scoffed as she related the exchange to a clutch of Beijing-based reporters later that day. The British ambassador, teacup frozen in mid-air, hastily declared the minister’s comments off-the-record. Chaguan attended that long-ago embassy tea party during a first posting to China. Back then Communist Party officials routinely called same-sex attraction a sickness carried by foreigners and Chinese doctors classified it as a mental disorder. Criminal penalties for homosexual acts were abolished only in 1997.  A generation later, that era of denial seems almost quaint. On September 2nd Chaguan interviewed Peng Yanzi and Yang Yi, an openly—indeed cheerfully—gay Chinese couple, about their plans to register as one another’s legal guardian. Amid much joking and finishing of each other’s sentences in a coffee shop in Guangzhou, their southern home town, Mr Peng, 36, and Mr Yang, 31, explained the documents they are drafting with the help of a local public notary. The mutual agreement will allow each to take medical and some financial decisions for the other, should they grow infirm, undergo surgery or otherwise lose their faculties. They are among a pioneering band of same-sex Chinese couples taking advantage of a guardianship law initially drafted with the elderly in mind. This was amended in 2017 to cover all adults. A few months later creative lawyers and activists realised that registering as mutual guardians could give same-sex couples some legal protections, even if those fall well short of those provided by gay marriage. The democratic island of Taiwan legalised same-sex marriage in May, over the objections of conservatives steeped in Chinese cultural and religious values. For now, same-sex unions remain unthinkable on the Chinese mainland. Marriage between one man and one woman “suits our country’s national condition and historical and cultural traditions”, a spokesman for China’s parliament declared in August. “We’re using what we can find in the current legal system to protect ourselves,” says Mr Peng, who works for LGBT Rights Advocacy China, an NGO. He lives in an unusually laid-back metropolis. But mutual guardianships between gay people have also been signed in other cities, including Changsha, Nanjing and Shanghai. Nationwide attention was sparked in August when a notary’s office in Beijing, where every act is weighed for its political correctness, approved the capital’s first known same-sex guardianship agreement. Almost as significant, to activists, was the neutral, even supportive coverage of the event in state-owned media. Posts about mutual guardianship in Beijing have cumulatively earned over 100m views on Weibo, a microblogging platform. Official tolerance is not unlimited. Several notarial offices have used social media to announce same-sex guardianship agreements, only to swiftly delete the posts. Censors have stepped up efforts to shield Chinese audiences from depictions of gay life in films, on television and online. In late 2018 a female author of gay erotic fiction was jailed for ten years on pornography charges. Mr Peng and Mr Yang face a dilemma that is familiar to all who try to build a stronger civil society in China. They hope to see many more couples take advantage of mutual guardianship. They were shaken when a lesbian friend died, whereupon her parents took possession of her home and car, leaving her long-standing partner bereft. “We realised that in the eyes of the law, they were still strangers even after living together for six or seven years,” says Mr Peng about the lesbian couple. “Like roommates,” interjects Mr Yang. Beyond the practical benefits of guardianship, increasing the visibility of gay Chinese is a long-term goal. However, they would prefer not to attract too much attention, in case the government—which has yet to signal its view of same-sex guardianship agreements—decides that it disapproves. Gay groups in China take striking care to avoid terms liable to alarm the party, such as human or civil rights. Instead they stress how gay love is compatible with traditional family values. One of China’s largest support groups, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, gives pride of place to parents who profess their acceptance of their children’s homosexuality. One of the group’s recent meetings in Beijing was conspicuously wholesome. Smartly dressed mothers sat around the edge of the room, making small talk about options for reaching the gathering by public transport, and politely admiring smartphone pictures of each other’s offspring. Meanwhile, youngsters in campaign T-shirts put out folding chairs and rainbow flags. Once under way, the meeting featured testimonials from mothers and their lesbian daughters about family heartbreak and forgiveness. Ming, a 22-year old student at the meeting, is guardedly optimistic. The party no longer seeks to control every aspect of people’s personal lives as it did decades ago, she says. She sees government caution about gay marriage as a bid to avoid affronting majority public opinion. Attitudes to gay rights are generational, she reports. She has not come out to her own parents, who think of homosexuality as a disease. That is why her real name is not used here. But once those born in or after the 1990s become China’s mainstream, “I believe things will be different,” Ming says. Until then, gay campaigners will stress small, pragmatic steps like mutual guardianship. China’s rulers are obsessed with maintaining social stability. Gay Chinese couples are ready to help, by taking responsibility for their own welfare. At least the party now admits they exist. ■
