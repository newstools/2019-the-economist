A MAN LIES in a hospital bed, dying. But in his final days, he helps unravel his own murder; the solution links his grim fate to a lurid world of violence and corruption. With its ticking clock, and mix of private agony and grand themes, the case of Alexander Litvinenko was inherently theatrical. Now, in “A Very Expensive Poison”, it has been ingeniously reimagined on the stage of the Old Vic in London. In an operation so inept it might be comic were it not so cruel, in 2006 two Russian assassins poisoned Litvinenko with polonium in a London hotel, leaving a trail of radioactive smears. Under guard, their victim accused Vladimir Putin of orchestrating the hit. The play by Lucy Prebble, who turned another twisty news saga into zany drama in “Enron” (2009), begins with Marina Litvinenko pondering a push for a public inquiry into her husband’s death, in the face of obstructive British ministers. “It will stop it happening again, yes?” she asks—ironically, given the botched poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018. “I was really struck by the bald-faced lies and denials [from Russia],” Ms Prebble says, but also “by the shabby cowardice of the British response…There was something in it that was a harbinger for now.”  Her play traces Litvinenko’s past as an agent of the FSB, Russia’s main security service, and his family’s flight to London after he alleged, among other things, that his colleagues had schemed to kill Boris Berezovsky. (The oligarch sought refuge in Britain, too, and died murkily in 2013.) At the same time it dramatises the sleuthing that led to the culprits. “He has to work harder to be trusted, because he’s seen as too trustworthy,” notes a detective grappling with the FSB’s warped code, in which honesty is a liability—speaking for the many Britons who were stunned by the irruption in their capital of these reckless conspiracies. “A Very Expensive Poison” weaves a moving portrait of a marriage—“You’re in a bad mood because you’re hungry,” Marina tells Alexander—with self-referential jokes and escalating high-jinks. Berezovsky sings a vaudeville number; the origins of polonium are outlined in verse. The antics are meant “to capture how overwhelming and tonally inconsistent life feels,” the playwright says. “Just like on your social-media feed; a funny cat next to a terrorist attack next to a dear friend’s depression.” The helter-skelter spectacle is also an insightful commentary on the way power is now wielded, in Russia and beyond. Apart from the Litvinenkos, the main character is Mr Putin, who emerges as a kind of sinister ringmaster. His creepy persona reflects the winking mendacity and distracting stunts that typify his real-life rule. Stagecraft mimics statecraft—which is itself a distorted form of entertainment. In a bold scene, the Putin of the play recounts the theatre siege in Moscow in 2002 in which 130 hostages died. “As soon as anyone starts telling a story,” he warns, “they start telling a lie.” The role is “an expression of how easy it is to manipulate and control a population,” says Ms Prebble. “In this case, an audience.” It was over nine years before a judge in the eventual public inquiry found that Mr Putin had “probably” approved Litvinenko’s murder. As Luke Harding, a journalist who wrote the gripping book on which the play is based, says, there is no prospect that the assassins will be extradited from Russia (where one is an MP). But art, he thinks, offers its own form of justice. If so, the reckoning will continue next year, when an opera about the case opens at Grange Park Opera in Surrey. It will allude to Tchaikovsky and Russian football chants, says Wasfi Kani, the company’s boss. And, like the play, it will invoke the “love and betrayal and jeopardy” that all drama craves—and that make Litvinenko’s story enduringly tragic. ■
