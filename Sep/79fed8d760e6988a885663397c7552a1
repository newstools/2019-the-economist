AS GLOBAL LEADERS prepare for the UN climate change summit next week, we debate what changes individuals can make today to help limit the effects of climate change. The Economistâ€™s environment editor, Catherine Brahic, hosts a roundtable with Christiana Figueres, who convenes Mission 2020 to reduce global carbon emissions; Ed Davey, a director of the Food and Land Use Coalition with the World Resources Institute; and Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change in the school of engineering at Manchester University.
