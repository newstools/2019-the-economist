You surrender yourself at the airport,Maybe by saying:“I am a refugee, seeking asylum.”You are told that in order to stay,You must first overstay.You are coerced to break a lawIn order to seek protection.The hard faces and unfeeling eyesWithout a common languageOr iota of empathy,Tell you to go backTo where you came from, but you can’t.There is nothing for you there but flamesAnd drone strikes.You may have friends who have been forcibly disappeared, bodies never found.You have seen the curve of your brother’s body being shot in broad daylight, folding like a question mark as if to askIf the world even cares about your story. You try to form the words that convey your truthBut people don’t want to hear it, not here.It is more convenient to blame you for daring to exist, your body is hyper visible butDehumanisedIn the reading down of judgments orBlack letters of legislation;Written by men and women from the comfortOf sleek air-conditioned rooms, with a sea view,Who cannot see you and never envision you as a person.You have done nothing wrong and yet you areAn all too convenient diversion from the real problems at hand.In this crowded reclaimed landscape,The jagged buildings are like the uncountableBars of a jail cell.Your passport is confiscated by authoritiesAnd you cannot move forward, only backward, handcuffed to the aeroplane seat.You’ve heard stories about the ones that they send back,And pray each day it will not be you.Or if you languish here, your children who are born to the Bauhinia flagAnd learn its languages and customs,Calling no other place homeWill never have legal status.You live without an income and rely on the kindness of strangers to ensureYour descendants are educated for their ownUncertain future. You always hear furious questionsAbout why you chose to come here.As if there is a choice between a death rattle and purgatory.The blackened streets ooze with inertia, a dominant populationUnaware of their privilege.To not be drafted at random in this generation,To not have to demand asylum and put their lives in another person’s hands.They have forgotten how grandfather and grandmother arrived here,The subdivided flats and subdivisions of identity meanThey will never call themselves the sons and daughters of asylum seekers.But the blood in their veinsIs of the people who managed to steal away in the middle of the night, across borders,Swimming oceans and traversing countriesIn the hope of witnessing another daybreak.They have more in common with you than they would ever admit—They have merely won a lottery of birth and no more. _____________ Dedication: to my maternal grandparents, who fled their home for political reasons and reinvented themselves elsewhere, to give their descendants a more stable future. It is in their memory that I call into question our lack of compassion and support of those living as refugees in Hong Kong society today. Originally published in Voice & Verse magazine, 2019
