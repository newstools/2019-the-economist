Dear Reader, This month we have begun rolling out a new Economist.com website, starting with a small number of our readers. Some of you will already have noticed the difference. The version of the site you are now on is designed to display more quickly, offer clear navigation and make it easy for you to find the best of The Economist’s journalism.  The top of the home page showcases The Economist today, seven stories selected for you every day. It includes topical news analysis, an article from one of our columnists, a daily chart, highlights from the weekly edition and “Moreover”, a lighter look at developments around the world. We hope The Economist today will help you catch up quickly with the best of our journalism each day. Elsewhere on the redesigned home page we have given more prominence to our in-depth Special reports and Technology quarterlies, and to “Graphic detail”, our popular data-visualisation feature. We have introduced the “In context” section, in which we offer a selection of stories, from the current edition or our archive, on a big subject—such as Brexit or the US-China trade war. And we have reintroduced “Readers’ favourites”, to show you the stories that other readers are enjoying. The individual article pages, meanwhile, have also been redesigned to be cleaner and more readable. Over the past year we have spoken to many of you to understand your reading habits and preferences. We took your feedback into account as we developed the new site, and we will continue to do so as our engineering team completes the roll-out. If you have any comments or suggestions, please write to me at zmb@economist.com. I look forward to hearing from you. Zanny Minton-Beddoes, Editor-in-chief
