THE ECONOMIST launched the Open Future initiative last year to remake the case for the values of liberalism, human rights, diversity and free trade, at a time when they are under threat. It aims to encourage a global conversation with our critics as well as supporters, and to attract a younger audience in particular. The Open Future Festival is the live embodiment of our editorial mission. It is a chance to discuss ideas and identify practical solutions to the problems of the 21st century.  The events take place on October 5th in Hong Kong, Manchester and Chicago. (Tickets are still available here.) On the day, a livestream will be available below.
