BRITISH HEADLINES are dominated by the contest to become the next Conservative prime minister, and the Tories' divisions over Brexit. But the opposition Labour Party, too, is split over Britain's relationship with the EU. Anne McElvoy interviews John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, who is one of the strongest voices calling for a second referendum and says Labour should campaign to remain in the EU. She asks him about revoking Article 50, if he would push for a vote of no confidence to force a general election, whether he has ambitions to become Labour leader and what the party is doing to root out anti-Semitism.
