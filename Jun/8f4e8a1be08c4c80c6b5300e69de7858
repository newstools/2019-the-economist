ARMISTEAD MAUPIN was one of the first writers to bring gay and transsexual characters to a mainstream audience. “Tales of the city” began as a series of stories published in a San Francisco newspaper in the 1970s. In this episode of “The Economist asks” podcast, Anne McElvoy asks him about what drew him back to the setting of 28 Barbary Lane to tell a new batch of tales of queer America. Fifty years on from the Stonewall riots that sparked the LGBT civil-rights movement, Mr Maupin talks about how far there is still to go, what young gay men can never understand about his generation, and why he has finally decided to abandon his beloved San Francisco.
