 THERESA MAY stepped down as leader of the Conservative Party on June 7th, but she will remain as prime minister until her successor is chosen. The first round of voting took place on June 13th; Boris Johnson topped the ballot of Tory MPs, with Jeremy Hunt a distant second and Michael Gove third. Three candidates, Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Esther McVey, failed to get enough votes to go through to the next round and Matt Hancock pulled out on June 14th. The remaining six candidates will go through to the second round of voting, which is scheduled for June 18th. After further votes MPs will then send two names to party members, who will make the final choice. The result of their vote will be announced before Parliament rises for summer. Betfair Exchange, a gambling website, has been tracking puntersâ€™ predictions on the next Tory leader. According to the wisdom of the betting crowd, a handful of candidates stand out. But there is only one clear frontrunner. Anne McElvoy, host of The Economist asks, spoke to Jeremy Hunt and Rory Stewart about their leadership plans:  Source: Betfair Exchange
