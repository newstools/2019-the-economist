Join journalists from The Economist for the second annual Open Future Festival on Saturday, October 5th 2019. Held in three cities simultaneously—Hong Kong, Manchester and Chicago—it is a chance for people from across the ideological spectrum to meet and debate vital issues on the future of open societies. Hear talks and panels by prominent figures from politics, business, civil society and the arts. The festival themes include free speech and free trade; the environment and inequality; the rise of populism and anxiety over the algorithmic society.  Come and share your ideas during a day of exciting discussions, curated content and exhibitions, immersive experiences and the chance to make connections with hundreds of festival attendees.
