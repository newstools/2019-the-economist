WE ARE looking for a new journalist to strengthen our coverage of sub-Saharan Africa. The job will be based somewhere in Africaâ€”exactly where is open for negotiation with the successful candidate. It will involve a lot of travel. Applicants should send an original unpublished article of up to 600 words on an African topic suitable for publication in The Economist, a CV and a cover letter to africawriter@economist.com. The deadline for applications is July 19th 2019.  The article is the most important part of the application. We will read it blind (ie, without looking at your name or where you are from). If what you write is not exceptionally good, we will not look at your CV. This is to ensure that the process is as unbiased and meritocratic as possible. Anyone is welcome to apply, regardless of citizenship, ethnic origin, sex, religious beliefs, disability, sexual orientation or age. Previous experience as a journalist is desirable but not essential. What we most want is original thinking, good analytical skills and, above all, good writing.
