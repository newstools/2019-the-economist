“America does not want to witness a food fight, they want to know how we’re going to put food on their table.” So said Kamala Harris, the junior senator from California, on the second night of this week’s Democratic primary debate on June 27th. The line, while clearly scripted, provoked raucous applause, suggesting that the assembled audience was more interested in policy disagreements than bickering and personal attacks. That is, for the most part, what the candidates gave them.  According to an analysis of the first Democratic debate by The Economist, the vast majority of the candidates’ time—more than 70%—was spent discussing specific policies. Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, and Julián Castro, a former housing secretary, impressed with their command of health-care and immigration policy. These issues took up 10% and 9% of the debate, respectively. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, meanwhile, spoke at length about economic and foreign policy, which each represented about 10% of debate time. Other topics, such as climate change and gun control, received less attention. Such issues may be of little concern to primary voters. According to YouGov, a pollster, America’s biggest political divides run along demographic, not policy lines. Nonetheless, this week’s debate may still prove consequential. During Thursday’s tussle, Ms Harris pressed Mr Biden, the front-runner, over his civil rights record, including his opposition to school busing ordered by America’s Department of Education in the 1970s. The exchange may damage his standing among his core supporters. Prior to the debate, punters on PredictIt, a political-betting market, gave Ms Harris a 14% chance of winning the primary in South Carolina, where most Democratic primary voters are black. After her performance on Thursday, her chances jumped to 43%.
