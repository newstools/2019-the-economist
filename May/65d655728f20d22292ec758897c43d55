EUROPEAN POLITICS is a febrile place. The old centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) and the old centre-left Party of European Socialists (PES) have long dominated the continent’s politics but are now ceding their dominance. Tomorrow’s European election results will probably show that the two are the big losers. Who should replace them? Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right leader, will marshal a nationalist right-wing party. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, will try to found a liberal pro-European force. Neither will succeed.  Mainstream national leaders will want a figure who can get things done, who is acceptable to the centre-right European People’s Party; to the centre-left Party of European Socialists and possibly to liberal and green camps. They will look for someone who crosses old ideological boundaries and who can make Europe relevant at a time when the continent is declining in global significance. They will stumble upon Margrethe Vestager. Ms Vestager has served as education, interior and economy minister of Denmark despite belonging to a tiny left-liberal party. As European Commissioner since 2014 she has applied both a liberal sense of consumer rights and a centre-left commitment to defending the little guy to the task of regulating technology giants. She has taken on tax dodgers, infringers of personal privacy and market distorters and defeated them all. Thrusting machos from Silicon Valley have turned up in her office, berated her and come off the worse. The EU in 2019 faces an array of security and economic threats. It needs a powerful, efficient leader with experience of the Commission and a sense of how the world is changing. It needs a leader who can stand up for Europe and initiate legislation defending its citizens. It needs someone acceptable to left and right, north and south. Many candidates will put their names forward. Ms Vestager ticks all the boxes. Europe would be foolish to overlook her.
