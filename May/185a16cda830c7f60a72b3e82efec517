IN THIS SPECIAL edition of Babbage, host Kenneth Cukier examines how humanitarian organisations use data and what they can learn from the profit-making tech industry. Access to the right data can be as valuable in humanitarian crises as water or medical care, but it can also be dangerous. Misused or in the wrong hands, the same information can put already vulnerable people at further risk. This episode was recorded live from Wilton Park, in collaboration with the United Nations OCHA Humanitarian Data Centre.
