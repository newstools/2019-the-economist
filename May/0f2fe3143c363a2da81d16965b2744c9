THE MARKET for avocados has undergone a transformation unlike that of any other fruit (yes, fruit) over the past few decades—from chic canapé of the 1970s to millennial staple today. In 2018 Americans consumed 3.5kg (7.7lbs) of avocado per person—nearly four times the level in 2000. Even McDonald’s is serving up guacamole. Yet the outlook for American avocado lovers is a concern. In California last year, where 80% of America’s avocados are grown, heatwaves and wildfires destroyed trees. This year was always destined to be a little less satisfying for farmers, as the alternate-year-bearing nature of avocado trees means that a large crop is followed by a smaller yield the following year. But rains and cold weather have exacerbated the problem, with this year threatening to be the worst harvest in over a decade.  Imports have risen sharply as American demand has grown. In the mid-1990s the Department of Agriculture (USDA) lifted an 83-year-old ban on Mexican avocados. Imports from Mexico, where avocados can be grown all year round, made up a staggering 87% of American avocado consumption in 2017-18. The USDA is forecasting this share to rise to 93% for the coming season. Additional imports may also come from Chile and Peru. But the nature of the crop means that farmers can sit on their harvest and wait for prices to surge, as avocados can hang on trees for several months without rotting. On April 1st the price for Mexican Hass avocados rose by a third—the biggest one-day price rise in almost a decade. This may be down to a combination of factors: America’s increased threats to close the border and Mexican farmers waiting for Cinco de Mayo, a major festival on May 5th, to hike prices. The threat of new tariffs, border frictions and a low harvest in California might cause even more price volatility in the coming months. Millennials might want to try something else on their toast.
