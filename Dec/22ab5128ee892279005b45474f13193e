DECEMBER 31ST is always a day for bleary-eyed resolutions to adopt better habits, as people raise a glass to a new year (and in 2019, to a new decade). Many of those promises seem outlandish when nursing a hangover the next morning. But it seems that people really do change their behaviour. Good intentions abound. Each year Google reports a global surge in searches about weight loss and dieting (although the overall rate at which users look up these topics has been gradually declining over time). Gyms see a spike in new memberships at the turn of the year. A recent poll of Americans by Ipsos found that they were especially keen to save more money in 2020. One in 12 even resolved to be more conscious about the environment.  This new year’s enthusiasm inevitably dwindles as the months pass. According to Foursquare, a location-based service, visits to the gym start moving back toward normal levels by the middle of February. By November, Google searches for healthy habits tend to reach their low point. However, Ipsos’s poll found that 45% of the Americans who had made any resolutions for 2019 claimed to have kept at least one as the end of the year approached. If you can make it past March, you have nearly a two-thirds chance of persisting until December.
