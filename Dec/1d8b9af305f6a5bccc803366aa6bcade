EVERY GENERATION has its own “Little Women”. Anne McElvoy asks Greta Gerwig, the Oscar-nominated writer and director of “Lady Bird”, about how she reinvented the classic story of Jo, Amy, Meg and Beth March for a new audience. They talk about her move to behind the camera, rescuing her characters from stereotypes and the economics of being a woman artist then and now. Also, how does Barbie, the subject of her next film, fare in the age of #MeToo?
